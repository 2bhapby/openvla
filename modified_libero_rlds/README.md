# Modified LIBERO RLDS Datasets

This repository contains the four modified [LIBERO](https://libero-project.github.io/main.html) datasets
used in the OpenVLA fine-tuning experiments, stored in RLDS data format. See Appendix E in the
[OpenVLA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09246) for details about the fine-tuning experiments and
specific dataset modifications, and see the [OpenVLA GitHub README](https://github.com/openvla/openvla/blob/main/README.md)
for instructions on how to run OpenVLA in LIBERO environments.
